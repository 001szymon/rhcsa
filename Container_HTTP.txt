Question: As the mshekhawat user, create a detached apache HTTP web server container with the name mysite and with the tag that has the lowest version(1-112) 
          from rhel8/httpd-24 image. Use the registry.redhat.io registry.

          Create and mount the ~/storage/html/ directory as a persistent storage to the container as /var/www/. 
          Create a sample index.html with contents as: <h1>My Container Apache HTTP Web Server</h1>
          
          Port 8080 on the container should be mapped to port 8080 on the host. 
          
          Declare the environment variables, HTTPD_USER and HTTPD_PASSWORD and use admin as their values.

          Configure the container as a service using systemd and make the web server/container persistent across reboot.
          
          It should accessbile from node2 as http://172.24.9.10:8080/
